Welcome to 'Dream House'! Below are some of the features and characteristics of my website:

1.Navbar: The website includes a navbar with active routes highlighting the current page. It features the website name, home page and when loggedin it shows update profile, and user profile. The user profile section dynamically changes based on whether a user is logged in or not, displaying the user's image and name on hover if logged in, and a login button if not.

2.Login Page: Clicking on the login button in the navbar redirects users to the login page. Password and email-based authentication is used for login, along with options for Google login and one of either GitHub, Facebook, or Twitter login. Users can also navigate to the registration page from here.

3.Register Page: Password and email-based authentication is used for registration, including fields for name, email, photoURL, and password. Password verification ensures the password meets specific criteria. After successful login or registration, a toast or sweet alert is displayed.

4.Banner: A slider with a minimum of 3 slides is included on the homepage, using either Daisy UI slider or Swiper slider.

5.Estate Section: The website includes an estate section with categorized listings. Each estate card contains relevant information such as title, image, price, status, area, location, and facilities, with a "View Property" button. Clicking on the "View Property" button redirects users to the estate details page, a protected route that displays detailed information about the selected estate.

404 Page: A custom 404 page is created for handling not found pages.
